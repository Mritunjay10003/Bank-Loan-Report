# 🏦 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard | Power BI & SQL Project

This repository contains a **Data Analyst Portfolio Project** focused on analyzing a bank’s loan data using **MS SQL Server** and **Power BI**. The project includes data extraction, transformation, analysis, and interactive visualization dashboards that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions about loan issuance, repayment, and borrower behavior.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- 📊 `Bank Loan Report.pbix`: Power BI report file containing all dashboards.

---

## 💡 Objective

The goal of this project is to explore, analyze, and visualize loan application data to generate insights about:

- Total loan applications and their monthly trends
- Disbursed (funded) loan amounts
- Amounts received (repayments)
- Loan performance (good vs. bad loans)
- Borrower profile analysis (region, purpose, employment length, etc.)

## 🧠 Problem Statements & Dashboards

### 📌 Dashboard 1: Summary View

A high-level KPI dashboard including:

- **Total Loan Applications** (with MTD & MoM tracking)
- **Total Funded Amount** (MTD & MoM)
- **Total Amount Received** (MTD & MoM)
- **Average Interest Rate** (MTD & MoM)
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)** (MTD & MoM)

#### Good vs. Bad Loan KPIs:

- Good Loan % | Applications | Funded Amount | Received Amount
- Bad Loan % | Applications | Funded Amount | Received Amount

#### Loan Status Grid View:

Categorized metrics for better decision-making:
- Loan Status-wise: Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, MTD values, Avg. Interest Rate, Avg. DTI
